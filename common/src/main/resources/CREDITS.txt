My greatest thanks to Biban_Auriu, for being the absolutely best guy I'll ever have an honour to work with, for, suprisingly over a year, on such amazing project as T&T.
It's amazing, how two complete strangers can come together and create something great. My deepest Thank You my dear friend for dedicating a wonderful, often times tough year to build this pack together.
